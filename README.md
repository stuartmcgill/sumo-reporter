# Sumo scraper

![Code coverage badge](https://github.com/stuartmcgill/sumo-scraper/blob/image-data/coverage.svg)

This console application scrapes the Sumo DB website to produce formatted reports.

Currently it can show ordered wrestler 'streaks' i.e. how many bouts wrestlers have won (or lost) in
a row, which may of course stretch across successive bashos.

# Usage

```
src/run.php report:streaks 
```

# Sample output
